    The ModelSerializer knows which members are available, and will automate

    included. If it's not in the list, it's left out.

        DRF allows you to implement something called a SerializerMethodField,
        which is a function that you define on the class and will be added into
        the JSON with the name you give it as a member variable.
        The name you give to the class method is assumed to be the word get_ with
        the name of the variable appended.

        is working on. In our case it's a poll.
